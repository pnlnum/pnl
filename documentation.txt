==== Manual ====


PNL is written in C and implements an hierarchical object system inspired from the Glib library.

PNL comes with a manual describing all the routines exported by the library. This documentation written in LaTeX can be produced in both PDF or HTML formats
  * [[http://pnl.gforge.inria.fr/docs/pnl-manual.pdf|PNL manual - PDF]]
  * [[http://pnl.gforge.inria.fr/docs/html/index.html|PNL manual - HTML]] (with one page per node)

==== Short list of changes across the releases ====

**Version 1.7.5** was released on 18 January 2017.\\
Short list of the most important changes:

  * Improve PNL detection for use in third party projects.
  * Fix some bugs under MSVC.


**Version 1.7.4** was released on 29 March 2016.\\
Short list of the most important changes:

  * Fix compiling errors in the examples under MSVC.
  * Provide a PnlConfig.cmake file to use CMake find_package command in config mode.
  * Enable in-place MPI reductions of PNL objects
  * Improve the efficiency of creating and evaluationg pnl_basis objects.


**Version 1.7.3** was released on 15 February 2016.\\
Short list of the most important changes:

  * PnlBasis objects can hold non tensor functions. The user can add its own functions to an existing basis.
  * Complex error functions based on the Faddeev package.


**Version 1.7.2** was released on 10 September 2015.\\
Short list of the most important changes:

  * Adds a CMake module to include the library in other projects.
  * Improves and fixes a bug in the pnl_basis module.
  * Adds the non central chi squared distribution to the random number generation toolbox.


**Version 1.7.1** was released on 22 July 2014.\\
Short list of the most important changes:

  * Minor fixes in the examples
  * Improvement of the inline facility detection in CMake. This fixes a bug of the 1.7.0 under Windows.


**Version 1.7.0** was released on 28 April 2014.\\
Short list of the most important changes:

  * Random number generation. All methods know how to handle QMC generators. Three new distributions have been added: log-normal, inverse gaussian and asymmetric double exponential distributions.
  * Linear Algebra. Computations of the logarithm and exponential of complex matrices. Sparse matrix object.
  * Optimization. Newton's algorithm with Armijo line search.
  * Polynomial regression. The evaluation of a multivariate polynomial has been greatly improved thanks to the use of sparse storage of these objects. This new implementation relies on sparse matrices.
  * Internal design. The internal structure of the top level object has been modified to keep track of the number references on to a given object, which has enabled us to improve by a great deal the memory management of lists and arrays.


**Version 1.6.0** was released on 22 March 2013.\\
Short list of the most important changes:

  * Improve Blas & Lapack detection on Mac OS X.
  * Fix a minor bug in two dimensional FFT.
  * Add a few functions for rounding (some are part of C99).


**Version 1.5.2** was released on 24 January 2013.\\
Short list of the most important changes:

  * The compilation chain has moved from the autotools to CMake.

**Version 1.5.1** was released on 16 October 2012.\\
Short list of the most important changes:

  * MPI_Reduce binding for PnlVect and PnlMat objects.
  * 2D FFT.
  * The user can define new function bases and register them for further usage as native bases.
  * The PnlObject structure has three new function members: clone, copy, new. It is mainly useful for inheritance purposes.

**Version 1.5.0** was released on 19 March 2012.\\
//This new release breaks the compatibility with older versions//. \\
Short list of the most important changes:

  * Most macros are renamed with a pnl_ prefix to avoid name clashes
  * Linear solver using a QR decomposition with column pivoting
  * Inverse of permutations and its applying it in place
  * Approximations for inverse hyperbolic functions (part of C99 but missing under Visual)


**Version 1.4.1** was released on 11 October 2011.\\
Short list of the most important changes:

  * A bug in pnl_mat_{lower,upper}_syslin has been fixed
  * Redesign of how Hmatrices are stored in memory
  * New functions to extract data from Hmatrices as vectors or matrices
  * New PnlArray type: array of PnlObjects. It is often a good alternative to using Hmatrices.

**Version 1.4.0** was released on 9 September 2011. \\
Short list of the most important changes:

  * Runge Kutta Fehler 45 integrator for n dimensional ODEs
  * Design of a new unit test framework
  * New organisation of the manual
  * LU decomposition of tridiagonal matrices
  * Cholesky factorization with complete pivoting for positive semidefinite matrices
  * New threadsafe Sobol generators (from John Burkardt)
  * Update to version 3.2.1 of Lapack
  * Integration of the Mersenne Twister Dynamic Creator version 0.6.1

**Version 1.3.3** was released on 10 March 2011.\\
The most important changes concern parallel computing, random number generators and multivariate polynomial bases:

  * Random number generators become thread-safe
  * Generation of Bessel random variables
  * A generator for parallel computing (MPI) is added : Dynamic created Mersenne Twister
  * Sparse polynomial bases based on hyperbolic sets of indices. Bases can be centered and normalised.
  * Save/Load interface based on MPI Pack/Unpack
