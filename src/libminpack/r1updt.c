/* subroutine r1updt
 *
 * given an m by n lower trapezoidal matrix s, an m-vector u,
 * and an n-vector v, the problem is to determine an
 * orthogonal matrix q such that
 *
 *               t
 *       (s + u*v )*q
 *
 * is again lower trapezoidal.
 *
 * this subroutine determines q as the product of 2*(n - 1)
 * transformations
 *
 *       gv(n-1)*...*gv(1)*gw(1)*...*gw(n-1)
 *
 * where gv(i), gw(i) are givens rotations in the (i,n) plane
 * which eliminate elements in the i-th and n-th planes,
 * respectively. q itself is not accumulated, rather the
 * information to recover the gv, gw rotations is returned.
 *
 * the subroutine statement is
 *
 *   subroutine pnl_minpack_r1updt(m,n,s,ls,u,v,w,sing)
 *
 * where
 *
 *   m is a positive integer input variable set to the number
 *     of rows of s.
 *
 *   n is a positive integer input variable set to the number
 *     of columns of s. n must not exceed m.
 *
 *   s is an array of length ls. on input s must contain the lower
 *     trapezoidal matrix s stored by columns. on output s contains
 *     the lower trapezoidal matrix produced as described above.
 *
 *   ls is a positive integer input variable not less than
 *     (n*(2*m-n+1))/2.
 *
 *   u is an input array of length m which must contain the
 *     vector u.
 *
 *   v is an array of length n. on input v must contain the vector
 *     v. on output v(i) contains the information necessary to
 *     recover the givens rotation gv(i) described above.
 *
 *   w is an output array of length m. w(i) contains information
 *     necessary to recover the givens rotation gw(i) described
 *     above.
 *
 *   sing is a logical output variable. sing is set true if any
 *     of the diagonal elements of the output s are zero. otherwise
 *     sing is set false.
