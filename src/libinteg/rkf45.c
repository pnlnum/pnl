 * 
 *     rkf45 is primarily designed to solve non-stiff and mildly stiff
 *     differential equations when derivative evaluations are inexpensive.
 *     rkf45 should generally not be used when the user is demanding
 *     high accuracy.
 * 
 *  abstract
 * 
 *     subroutine  rkf45  integrates a system of neqn first order
 *     ordinary differential equations of the form
 *              dy(i)/dt = f(t,y(1),y(2),...,y(neqn))
 *               where the y(i) are given at t .
 *     typically the subroutine is used to integrate from t to tout but it
 *     can be used as a one-step integrator to advance the solution a
 *     single step in the direction of tout.  on return the parameters in
 *     the call list are set for continuing the integration. the user has
 *     only to call rkf45 again (and perhaps define a new value for tout).
 *     actually, rkf45 is an interfacing routine which calls subroutine
 *     rkfs for the solution.  rkfs in turn calls subroutine  fehl which
 *     computes an approximate solution over one step.
 * 
 *     rkf45  uses the runge-kutta-fehlberg (4,5)  method described
 *     in the reference
 *     e.fehlberg , low-order classical runge-kutta formulas with stepsize
 *                  control , nasa tr r-315
 * 
 *     the performance of rkf45 is illustrated in the reference
 *     l.f.shampine,h.a.watts,s.davenport, solving non-stiff ordinary
 *                  differential equations-the state of the art ,
 *                  sandia laboratories report sand75-0182 ,
 *                  to appear in siam review.
 * 
 * 
 *     the parameters represent-
 *       f -- subroutine f(t,y,yp) to evaluate derivatives yp(i)=dy(i)/dt
 *       neqn -- number of equations to be integrated
 *       y(*) -- solution vector at t
 *       t -- independent variable
 *       tout -- output point at which solution is desired
 *       relerr,abserr -- relative and absolute error tolerances for local
 *             error test. at each step the code requires that
 *                  abs(local error) .le. relerr*abs(y) + abserr
 *             for each component of the local error and solution vectors
 *       iflag -- indicator for status of integration
 *       work(*) -- array to hold information internal to rkf45 which is
 *             necessary for subsequent calls. must be dimensioned
 *             at least  3+6*neqn
 *       iwork(*) -- integer array used to hold information internal to
 *             rkf45 which is necessary for subsequent calls. must be
 *             dimensioned at least  5
 * 
 * 
 *   first call to rkf45
 * 
 *     the user must provide storage in his calling program for the arrays
 *     in the call list  -      y(neqn) , work(3+6*neqn) , iwork(5)  ,
 *     declare f in an external statement, supply subroutine f(t,y,yp) and
 *     initialize the following parameters-
 * 
 *       neqn -- number of equations to be integrated.  (neqn .ge. 1)
 *       y(*) -- vector of initial conditions
 *       t -- starting point of integration , must be a variable
 *       tout -- output point at which solution is desired.
 *             t=tout is allowed on the first call only, in which case
 *             rkf45 returns with iflag=2 if continuation is possible.
 *       relerr,abserr -- relative and absolute local error tolerances
 *             which must be non-negative. relerr must be a variable while
 *             abserr may be a constant. the code should normally not be
 *             used with relative error control smaller than about 1.e-8 .
 *             to avoid limiting precision difficulties the code requires
 *             relerr to be larger than an internally computed relative
 *             error parameter which is machine dependent. in particular,
 *             pure absolute error is not permitted. if a smaller than
 *             allowable value of relerr is attempted, rkf45 increases
 *             relerr appropriately and returns control to the user before
 *             continuing the integration.
 *       iflag -- +1,-1  indicator to initialize the code for each new
 *             problem. normal input is +1. the user should set iflag=-1
 *             only when one-step integrator control is essential. in this
 *             case, rkf45 attempts to advance the solution a single step
 *             in the direction of tout each time it is called. since this
 *             mode of operation results in extra computing overhead, it
 *             should be avoided unless needed.
 * 
 * 
 *   output from rkf45
 * 
 *       y(*) -- solution at t
 *       t -- last point reached in integration.
 *       iflag = 2 -- integration reached tout. indicates successful return
 *                    and is the normal mode for continuing integration.
 *             =-2 -- a single successful step in the direction of tout
 *                    has been taken. normal mode for continuing
 *                    integration one step at a time.
 *             = 3 -- integration was not completed because relative error
 *                    tolerance was too small. relerr has been increased
 *                    appropriately for continuing.
 *             = 4 -- integration was not completed because more than
 *                    3000 derivative evaluations were needed. this
 *                    is approximately 500 steps.
 *             = 5 -- integration was not completed because solution
 *                    vanished making a pure relative error test
 *                    impossible. must use non-zero abserr to continue.
 *                    using the one-step integration mode for one step
 *                    is a good way to proceed.
 *             = 6 -- integration was not completed because requested
 *                    accuracy could not be achieved using smallest
 *                    allowable stepsize. user must increase the error
 *                    tolerance before continued integration can be
 *                    attempted.
 *             = 7 -- it is likely that rkf45 is inefficient for solving
 *                    this problem. too much output is restricting the
 *                    natural stepsize choice. use the one-step integrator
 *                    mode.
 *             = 8 -- invalid input parameters
 *                    this indicator occurs if any of the following is
 *                    satisfied -   neqn .le. 0
 *                                  t=tout  and  iflag .ne. +1 or -1
 *                                  relerr or abserr .lt. 0.
 *                                  iflag .eq. 0  or  .lt. -2  or  .gt. 8
 *       work(*),iwork(*) -- information which is usually of no interest
 *                    to the user but necessary for subsequent calls.
 *                    work(1),...,work(neqn) contain the first derivatives
 *                    of the solution vector y at t. work(neqn+1) contains
 *                    the stepsize h to be attempted on the next step.
 *                    iwork(1) contains the derivative evaluation counter.
 * 
 * 
 *   subsequent calls to rkf45
 * 
 *     subroutine rkf45 returns with all information needed to continue
 *     the integration. if the integration reached tout, the user need onl
 *     define a new tout and call rkf45 again. in the one-step integrator
 *     mode (iflag=-2) the user must keep in mind that each step taken is
 *     in the direction of the current tout. upon reaching tout (indicated
 *     by changing iflag to 2),the user must then define a new tout and
 *     reset iflag to -2 to continue in the one-step integrator mode.
 * 
 *     if the integration was not completed but the user still wants to
 *     continue (iflag=3,4 cases), he just calls rkf45 again. with iflag=3
 *     the relerr parameter has been adjusted appropriately for continuing
 *     the integration. in the case of iflag=4 the function counter will
 *     be reset to 0 and another 3000 function evaluations are allowed.
 * 
 *     however,in the case iflag=5, the user must first alter the error
 *     criterion to use a positive value of abserr before integration can
 *     proceed. if he does not,execution is terminated.
 * 
 *     also,in the case iflag=6, it is necessary for the user to reset
 *     iflag to 2 (or -2 when the one-step integration mode is being used)
 *     as well as increasing either abserr,relerr or both before the
 *     integration can be continued. if this is not done, execution will
 *     be terminated. the occurrence of iflag=6 indicates a trouble spot
 *     (solution is changing rapidly,singularity may be present) and it
 *     often is inadvisable to continue.
 * 
 *     if iflag=7 is encountered, the user should use the one-step
 *     integration mode with the stepsize determined by the code or
 *     consider switching to the adams codes de/step,intrp. if the user
 *     insists upon continuing the integration with rkf45, he must reset
 *     iflag to 2 before calling rkf45 again. otherwise,execution will be
 *     terminated.
 * 
 *     if iflag=8 is obtained, integration can not be continued unless
 *     the invalid input parameters are corrected.
 * 
 *     it should be noted that the arrays work,iwork contain information
 *     required for subsequent integration. accordingly, work and iwork
 *     should not be altered.
